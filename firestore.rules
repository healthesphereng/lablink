/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for LabLink.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles,
 * appointments, and test results. Only the authenticated user can access their
 * own data. Lab tests are considered public and can be read by anyone.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information.
 * - /lab_tests/{labTestId}: Stores information about available lab tests.
 * - /users/{userId}/appointments/{appointmentId}: Stores appointment information for a user.
 * - /users/{userId}/appointments/{appointmentId}/test_results/{testResultId}: Stores test results associated with an appointment.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User listing is disallowed to protect user privacy.
 * - Lab tests are publicly readable.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - The data structure itself denormalizes authorization by nesting appointments and test results under the user's document. This makes
 * authorization checks simpler and more efficient as the user ID is directly available in the path.
